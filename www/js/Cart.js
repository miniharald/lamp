    alert(`
      I am the cart. I'm still really stupid ðŸ˜¢!
      I have no render-method and no methods that calc sums.
      I have no add and remove methods...
      But I know that you tried to add this product to me:
      ${JSON.stringify({ ...product, cart: undefined }, '', '  ')}
    `.replace(/\n\s*/g, '\n'))
  }
